                    <p>Capoeira is often referred to as a Brazilian martial art, but there is no clear answer as to whether it originated in Africa or Brazil. The lack of information is due to the fact that only a few documents from before the 19th century have survived, which mention capoeira.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly, the first event that led to the emergence of capoeira in Brazil was the importation of slaves from Africa. Therefore, the history of capoeira is usually told starting from the year 1500 when the Portuguese led by a conquistador named Pedro Alvares Cabral discovered Brazil.<img style="float: right; margin-left: 3rem; margin-right: 2rem;" src="https://i1.wp.com/kungfukingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Louis-takes-a-little-RR-in-Brazil.jpg?fit=853,480&ssl=1">They went to India but deviated strongly to the west and ended up in new lands, which Portugal immediately declared colonial claims on. One of the primary tasks of the colonizers was to provide themselves with slave labor. For this, they tried to subjugate the Brazilian Indians. But such an idea turned out to be unsuccessful: local slaves were weak and quickly died or fled to their settlements.</p>
                    <p>As a result, the Portuguese had to bring slaves from other colonies located in Africa. Slaves brought with them their traditions and culture. This is where disagreements begin regarding the origin of capoeira: did slaves bring it as part of their culture from Africa? Or did capoeira originate in Brazil under the influence of African traditions? There is no clear answer to these questions. But there are several theories, often based not on facts but rather on legends than historical facts.</p>
                    <p>The most popular theory about the origin of capoeira claims that it originated in the legendary settlement of escaped slaves Quilombo dos Palmares. After the defeat of this settlement by the Portuguese, capoeira continued to develop among slaves. It had to be disguised as a dance to hide its true nature from slave owners. This theory is often criticized because not only capoeira, but also dances (like all manifestations of African culture) were often prohibited and persecuted. <img style="float: left; margin-right: 3rem;" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51cfa3a4e4b025acba7306f5/1374229675048-VPZUJQM6UWS6KM027EZV/escravos6.png?format=1000w">Therefore, disguising one forbidden phenomenon under another did not make sense.</p>
                    <p>The most plausible assumption is that in Brazil there was a synthesis of different types of martial arts, dances, music brought from different regions of Africa. Most likely, this happened in the 19th century in Salvador (the capital of Bahia state).</p>
                    <p>From 1814, all manifestations of Brazilian culture began to be repressed and persecuted. Before that, there was no clear position on them. Someone prohibited them, someone even encouraged them, because they saw them as a way to reduce internal tension in conditions of slavery or as a way to sow discord between different ethnic groups of Africans.</p>
                    <p>In 1888, the so-called "documented" stage in the history of capoeira began. In this year, the "Golden Law" was signed, which abolished slavery. Many slaves found themselves on the streets without work or means of survival and were completely unadapted to the new way of life. It is not surprising that many turned to crime. Capoeira became a weapon in the criminal world.<img style="float: right; margin-left: 3rem; margin-right: 2rem;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0d/ed/44/0ded449bda46dafd2425711cba6fd922.jpg"> The word "capoeirista" was associated with the words "hooligan" and "bandit". Therefore, four years later, in 1892, the first constitution of the Brazilian Republic banned capoeira. The police began to eradicate it. It is believed that in Bahia, where capoeira was more of a ritual dance-fight, it proved to be more viable. However, the ritual should not be understood as a "soft" style. There were also constant fights, knives were used, and there were bloodshed and killings.</p>
                    <p>Capoeira of that time was very different from today's capoeira. It did not have acrobatics, ground movements, or the familiar kicks used today. Even the berimbau was only used in the 20th century.</p>
                    <p>In 1930, a military coup took place in Brazil, and a nationalist-minded president, Getulio Vargas, came to power. With his arrival, persecution of capoeira weakened, and capoeiristas no longer had to hide. Moreover, Vargas actively helped develop capoeira as a Brazilian national sport.</p>
                    <p>As a result, in 1932 in Salvador, Mestre Bimba (real name Manoel dos Reis Machado) opened the first capoeira academy - Centro de Cultura Fisica Regional Baiano. The name of this academy gave rise to the name of the "regional" style. Mestre Bimba was the first to use colored belts to assess students' level. The style he taught was not traditional capoeira. Mestre Bimba slightly changed it, introducing certain borrowings from other martial arts.</p>
                    <p>The first school of traditional capoeira opened almost ten years later - in 1941, Mestre Pastinha (Vicente Ferreira Pastinha) opened the school "Capoeira Angola". Later, following the name of the school, traditional capoeira began to be called "angola". Mestre Pastinha was the first to introduce a form into capoeira angola. His students wore black pants and yellow shirts.</p>
                    <p>Mestre Bimba and Mestre Pastinha are key figures in the history of capoeira. It is thanks to them that capoeira became what we know it as today.</p>
