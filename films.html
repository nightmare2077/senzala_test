                    <h2>Besouro</h2>
                    <p>The previous century, the 1920s. A period when slavery had already been abolished, but the descendants of African Americans still struggled to fit into modern society. Entrepreneurs benefited from free labor, but tolerance and a sense of equality were still far from being fully established. Former slaves developed a unique dance form mixed with martial arts - capoeira. However, the government considered this type of sport illegal, so all capoeira enthusiasts were persecuted by law enforcement. The main character, who dedicated most of his life to learning this art, has to organize something like an underground club of enthusiasts-partisans. The enthusiasts, led by the legendary master Manuel Pereira, better known as "Bug," go on raids through the night city, destroying plantations and agricultural machinery. Many farmers suffered at the hands of the partisans, but each of them did not want to part with the slave-owning system. African Americans came to the underground club every day to learn this amazing art and be able to resist human rights oppressors.</p>
