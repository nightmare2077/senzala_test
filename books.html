                    <h2>Capoeira: A Brazilian Art Form: History, Philosophy, and Practice</h2>
                    <h3>Bira Almeida</h3>
                    <p>Capoeira weaves fighting, music, dance, prayer, and ritual into an urgent strategy by which people live, struggle, celebrate, and survive together. In this book Bira Almeida--or Mestre Acordeon as he is respectfully called in capoeira circles--documents his own tradition with both the panoramic eye of the historian and the passionate heart of the capoeirista. He transports the reader from the damn of New World history in Brazil to the streets of twentieth-century Bahia (the spiritual home of capoeira) to the giant urban centers of North America (wher capoeira is now spreading in new lineages from the old masters). This book is valuable for anyone interested in ethnocultural traditions, martial arts, and music, as well as for those who want to listen to the words of an actual mestre dedicated to preserving his Afro-Brazilian legacy.</p>

                    <h2>The Little Capoeira Book</h2>
                    <h3>Nestor Capoeira</h3>
                    <p>The book starts off by giving an in-depth history of the Brazilian art of Capoeira. The last half of the book deals with the movements and techniques of Capoeira, including: offensive and defensive movements, basic kicks, takedowns, advanced kicks and movements, head butts, hand strikes, and knee and elbow strikes. Each of the techniques and maneuvers are vividly depicted by drawings that are very easy to understand and learn from. There is also an explanation of both Angolan and Regional versions of most of the techniques. This book gives a very good description of the history, game, and philosophy of Capoeira. The book contains diagrams showing various positions and movements and discusses attacking and defending strategies and the critical aspects of feinting. Over 100 photographs and illustrations are included.</p>

                    <h2>A Street-Smart Song: Capoeira Philosophy and Inner Life</h2>
                    <h3>Nestor Capoeira</h3>
                    <p>A Street-Smart Song delves into the boundless philosophical depths of capoeira, the fascinating synthesis of Brazilian dance and self-defense. Drawing from a wide range of sources—the streets of Salvador and Rio de Janeiro, the teachings of the old masters Pastinha, Bimba, and Leopoldina, and the brutal economic realities inflicted on the poorest of Brazil—Nestor Capoeira paints an indelible portrait of this living art, its spiritual heritage, and its vital place in a world hypnotized by media and crushed by poverty. The traditional poems and songs of capoeira are here, along with the author’s lively discussions of everything from the space age and television’s impact on third world culture to Candomble and capoeira’s life-changing lessons. Rounding out this absorbing cultural survey are historical photos, sketches of weapons and instruments, and fully illustrated fighting movements, taught step by step.</p>

                    <h3>Gerard Taylor</h3>
                    <p> The first is a two part series of books that covers the origins of Capoeira and specifically looks at the origins of the art and leaves us at the beginning of the 20th century. The book opens with the slave trade of the 1500s and explores the music, self defense, religions, and other cultural elements that influenced the art of Capoeira. A fascinating read that dives into the 500 year old history of Capoeira and a must read for anyone who wants to learn the art.</p>

                    <h2>Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola v2</h2>
                    <h3>Gerard Taylor</h3>
                    <p>ike the title implies, this two part series of book covers the origins of Capoeira and takes the story forward to the present day. I decided to place the second volume of Gerard Taylor’s Book higher on the list because modern history will generally impact us more. As soon as I started reading this book I was extremely impressed by the level of detail, the academic rigor to source material, and the relevance to Capoeira today. Gerard Taylor goes over the competition between Capoeira styles, the origin of the chord system, and many other things you may have wondered about, but never knew who to ask about. This book is a gem.</p>

                    <h3>Mestre Casquinha</h3>
                    <p>Capoeira is a rather unique art form and a distinct and multifaceted universe of infinite possibilities in its own right. The Capoerista treads on a long and emotional path and his journey is invariably marked by challenges, moments of learning and instances of bliss. It is altogether a magical experience that can bring a happier life within reach. To be part of this universe of Capoeira is to reconnect with the warrior that lives within you, a fighter that never gives up.Through Capoeira one freely taps into that part within him that still dreams visions rich in color and melodies that resonate in his heart of hearts. A mental state is thereby revealed that instills confidence and shows you that you are capable of achieving, of making anything happen. At the same time it is a deeply personal affair. Its all on you. You are the warrior on the path to your own happiness.</p>
