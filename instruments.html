                    <h2>Berimbau</h2>
                    <p>Berimbau is a musical instrument used in capoeira. It is a long wooden or plastic bow with a string made of gutta-percha or nylon stretched across it.</p>
                    <p>Berimbau comes in several different sizes and tones, determined by the length and thickness of the bow and the tension of the string. Typically, capoeira groups use three different sizes of berimbau: gunga (large), medio (medium), and viola (small).</p>
                    <p>Berimbau plays a crucial role in capoeira as it sets the rhythm and tempo of the music. The berimbau player must be attentive to the movements and actions of other group members to tune into their rhythm and create a harmonious musical composition.</p>
                    <p>Overall, berimbau is an integral part of capoeira culture and is one of the most recognizable and symbolic instruments of this Brazilian martial art.</p>

                    <h2>Atabaque</h2>
                    <p>The atabaque in capoeira not only plays the role of a musical instrument, but is also an important element of communication between players and spectators. During the game on the atabaque, masters can use various signs and gestures to convey information to each other and create a certain mood.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the atabaque is an important element of capoeira training. Many schools and training centers use the atabaque to teach rhythmic sense and coordination of movements. There are also special classes for learning to play the atabaque.</p>
                    <p>Playing the atabaque has its own history and traditions. In the past, the atabaque was used in Brazilian tribes to create music and ritual dances. Today, it has become an integral part of Brazil's cultural heritage and attracts tourists from all over the world.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the atabaque in capoeira is a symbol of Brazilian culture and folk art that continues to attract attention and interest from people around the world. The atabaque usually plays rhythmic beats that help control the tempo and mood of capoeira. It has two heads, which are usually made from animal skins such as goats or bulls. The body of the atabaque can be made from various materials, including wood or plastic.</p>
                    <p>The atabaque in capoeira is also often used in combination with other instruments, such as berimbau and pandeiro. Together, they create a unique sound and atmosphere that are characteristic of capoeira.</p>

                    <h2>Pandeiro</h2>
                    <p>The pandeiro is a type of tambourine that is commonly used in Brazilian music, including capoeira. It is a versatile instrument that can produce a wide range of sounds, from sharp slaps to soft shuffles.</p>
                    <p>In capoeira, the pandeiro is often played alongside the berimbau and atabaque to create a rhythmic backdrop for the game. The player uses their fingers to strike the drumhead and create different rhythms and patterns.</p>
                    <p>The pandeiro is believed to have originated in Portugal and was brought to Brazil during the colonial period. It has since evolved to become an integral part of Brazilian music and culture.</p>
                    <p>One unique aspect of playing the pandeiro in capoeira is the use of the thumb to produce a deep bass sound. This technique, known as "thumbing," involves hitting the rim of the drumhead with the thumb while simultaneously striking the drumhead with the fingers.</p>

                    <h2>Agogôs</h2>
                    <p>Agogôs are percussion instruments commonly used in capoeira and other Brazilian music styles. They consist of two or more metal bells attached to a handle, usually made of wood or metal.</p>
                    <p>The number of bells on an agogô can vary, with some having two or three bells and others having as many as six or more. The size and shape of the bells can also vary, affecting the tone and pitch of the instrument.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their use in traditional music, agogôs have also been used in modern music styles such as jazz, rock, and electronic music. They have been sampled and incorporated into songs by artists such as Santana, Herbie Hancock, and Daft Punk.</p>
